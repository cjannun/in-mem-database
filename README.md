Enterprise SWE Practices Assignment

## How to run code:
- Install g++. Check version by running:
```
g++ --version
```
- Write code to interact with the db class in main() of db.cpp
- Compile and link source files by running:
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o db.o -c db.cpp
g++ -std=std++11 -o db.exe db.o
```
- Run executable:
```
.\db.exe
```

## Suggestions
I felt that the concept of assignemnt is good and has the potential to be a beneficial assignment for future students of Enterprise SWE Practices. However, I think that before becoming an "official" assignment, the assigment should be made a little more difficult/involved and the requirements for completion should be more clearly outlined. When working on this assignment, I wasn't sure if it should be a program that can be interacted with in the command line, or if I should have a Makefile to compile the source files. More clearly defined requirements make the project less stress for students while maintaining the difficulty of the assignment (because the students aren't being told how to accomplish those requirements).
